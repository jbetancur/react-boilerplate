## zero-react-starter

Tired of overly bloated and complex React starters/boilerplates? Do you need a starter that requires zero configuration that's not a black box? Here's our opinion for the ultimate React starter:

- react
- styled-components
- typescript
- jest
- react-testing-library
- eslint
- prettier
- dark mode theming via styled-components themes
- vscode settings
- zero css/scss files (unless you want that sort of thing)

zero-react-starter is intended for projects that require a little more upfront structure and tooling. For super simple projects something like `create-react-app` is the way to go.

#### yarn

```sh
cd <your-project-name>
yarn start
```

#### npm
```sh
cd <your-project-name>
npm start
```
